                      <p>This is the first project that I was involved from the very beginning to the end. I learned a lot about evidence-based design process. Being proactive in every step, I have laid a solid foundation for future design work.</p>
                      <p>I was also impressed with the importance of accessible design for people with impairments. A wheelchair user said:</p>

                      <p>I believe our work will benefit people significantly. I sincerely hope more and more people will join us in this cause and contribute to a better tomorrow for those in special needs.</p>
